## Running React on Repl.it

[Homeless](https://www.bowery.org/homelessness/) A person who lacks a secure place to live is considered homeless. They may choose to live on the streets, in a shelter, mission, single-room occupancy facility, an abandoned structure or vehicle, or in any other unstable or temporary setting. Eviction, substantially increased or extremely congested living, domestic abuse, job loss, and unsafe inadequate housing are a few potential reasons of this. These types of factors frequently contribute to the problem of homelessness in America. According to analysts, laws that prevented the United States from developing enough homes were the root cause of the current homelessness epidemic, which dates back decades. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, seven million tenants with extremely low incomes cannot find affordable housing.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
